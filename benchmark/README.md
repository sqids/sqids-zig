# Benchmark

The input number file is generated by `_gen.py`.
Its seed is committed, so no need to run it before each benchmark.

Run `uv run --directory="." gen_exes.py <REVSET>` to genererate the executables at each commits of the revision.
It will output the poop command to run to perform the iterative benchmark.
It shell out to jj and manipulate your working copy.
Make sure you pass a sound revset, and jj op restore will help if you messed up.
